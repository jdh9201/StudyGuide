              The File Transfer Protocol is a set of rules for exchanging files

              file from one computer to another. FTP is commonly used by web

              computer to the server and vice versa.

              sends messages to a server for forwarding. SMTP can both send and
              receive mail, but it's bad at queuing incoming messages, hence the
              common delegation to other protocols.
